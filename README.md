# menagerie-docs

A work-in-progress manual on creating content for my [dumb game](https://github.com/sand-bird/menagerie). 

There is a live build at **[sand-bird.github.io/menagerie-docs](https://sand-bird.github.io/menagerie-docs)**, though it's not necessarily up to date.

The schemas section ("Data Specifications") would be the most useful for self-reference -- ostensibly the reason I spent so much time on this *now* -- if it wasn't still basically empty. You should check out the [Conditions](https://sand-bird.github.io/menagerie-docs/conditions/) section, though, I'm pretty proud of that one so far.
