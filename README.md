# menagerie-docs

A work-in-progress manual on creating content for my [dumb game](sand-bird/menagerie). There is a live build at **[sand-bird.github.io/menagerie-docs](https://sand-bird.github.io/menagerie-docs)**, but it's not necessarily up to date.

The schemas section ("Data Specifications") is the most useful as a self-reference -- ostensibly the reason I spent so much time on this *now* -- but also the least developed. You should check out the [Conditions](https://sand-bird.github.io/menagerie-docs/conditions/) section though, I'm pretty proud of it. (That one's probably like 70% done.)
